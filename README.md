# Static Comp Challenge 1

## Introduction

This was my second solo project and first project where I created a page from scratch using HTML and CSS.

The prompt was to create a new page based on an original design. The structural specs and elements of the page needed to match the layout of the provided design. That said, I had a creative license for some styles such as images, copy, icons and color palette. See the image of the required layout below.

The goal was also to make this page compatible across different browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Chrome and have smooth transitions into different breakpoints for tablets and smartphones.
